2.3 BODY OF DATA

2.3.S
DRUG SUBSTANCE(S) (Ferric Hydroxide Polymaltose
Complex)

GENERAL INFORMATION (Ferric Hydroxide Polymaltose
Complex/ Global Calcium Private Limited)

Nomenclature
INN: Ferric Hydroxide Polymaltose Complex
CAS registry number: 53858-86-9
Compendial names: Not Available
Other names: Polymaltosate iron (III)
Iron polymaltose
Ferric polymaltose
Iron (III)-hydroxide polymaltose complex

Structure
Structural Formula
The structural formula of Ferric Hydroxide Polymaltose Complex is not determined.
Molecular Formula
The empirical formula of this high molecular weight complex of iron (III)-hydroxide and polymaltose can be expressed as follows:
[Fe(OH)3 x (H2O)1,5]n x [C6H10O5)m]x
Where:
n number of mono-hemi-hydrated iron (III)-hydroxide complexes (iron polymerization rate)
m polymerization rate of the anhydrous-dextrose ligand (polymaltose/polymerized- maltose complex)
x stoichiometric factor (correlation factor between the content of iron(III)-hydroxide and of polymaltose ligand)

General Properties
Physical Description
Ferric Hydroxide Polymaltose Complex is a brown or dark brown amorphous powder.
Solubility
The complex is water soluble and insoluble in ordinary organic solvents.
Polymorphism
Since Ferric Hydroxide Polymaltose Complex is an amorphous powder, polymorphism phenomena take not place.
pH
The pH of a 5% w/v aqueous solution of Iron (III) stays between 5.5 and 7.5.
